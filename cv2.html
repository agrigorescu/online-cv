                <em>September 2010 to June 2013</em>
                <p>I have concentrated most of my studies on the Computer Science aspect of my degree, because it is an area I am passionate about. I have studied mostly Object Oriented Programming with an accent on Java. Also, I have taken a module about Operating Systems which I enjoyed immensely and it is something i will be interested in pursuing further in the future. I found the Law modules a bit tedious, as I lacked the passion to want to pursue it further in my career. However, I am glad I persevered in studying them as I now have a better understanding of certain issues, both political and technological.</p>

                                    <li>I chose to design an Android App that let you see what music other people were listening around you.</li>
                                    <li>It was aimed at all mobile phone users.</li>
                                    <li>The specifications of the app were: to be able to play music internally, to connect to social media, to have access to the geo-location services on the phone, to be able to share information via the internet and exchange private chat messages.</li>
                                    <li>I was alone in designing and managing my project, and had to check in with my tutor every few weeks.</li>
                                    <li>I have researched extensively the legal aspects of my app at the encouragement of my tutor.</li>
                                    <li>Due to time constraints, the amount of research and other coding issues, the app was never developed further than a rough version.</li>

            <p>Although I am a very pragmatic person, I do enjoy seeing the world through the lenses of my camera. I like to explore my surrounding environment and look for the miracles of Mother Nature. I have recently participated in a photography competition at my Buddhist Center with the occasion of the Lantern Festival, where my photo won second place. Also, I like reading any kind of books, from historical novels to enciclopedias. My favourite genres being science fiction and thrillers/mystery novels. Equally, during summer, I find pleasure in playing a friendly match of badminton.</p>
